    "11. For each model, look at sub-scores from the folds of cross-validation to get a sense of \"error bars\" on the scores.\n",
    "12. Pick a model that you like. Best CV score is a reasonable metric, though you may choose to favour simpler models.\n",
    "13. Look at feature importances.\n",
    "14. (optional) Perform some more diagnostics like confusion matrix for classification, or \"predicted vs. true\" scatterplots for regression.\n",
